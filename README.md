# UNP_REGRESSION_PROJECT_with_python_applications_mental_state_prediction
Developed a Mental State Prediction Model using Python regression techniques to estimate emotional well-being based on behavioral, social, and lifestyle data. Performed data preprocessing, EDA, and trained regression models to identify key predictors influencing mental health outcomes.
During my value-added course with United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed a Mental State Prediction Model using Python to estimate individuals’ emotional well-being based on behavioral, social, and lifestyle factors. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, correcting data types, encoding categorical variables, and treating outliers using the IQR method. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I identified significant factors such as sleep duration, social interactions, work stress, and physical activity levels that influenced mental health outcomes. I applied and compared multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, and Random Forest Regressor, to predict mental state scores with optimal accuracy.

This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and statistical analysis, while providing practical experience in applying machine learning techniques to human behavioral and psychological data.
